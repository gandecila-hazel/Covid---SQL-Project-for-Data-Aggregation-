# **Covid SQL Project for Data Aggregation**
## This project explores data aggregation techniques in SQL to gain insights into the global COVID-19 pandemic.

Utilizing a robust COVID database, we'll leverage SQL functionalities to analyze various aspects, including:

1. Case and Death Trends:
Track the total confirmed cases and deaths over time globally and by region.
Identify countries with the highest and lowest case/death rates.
Compare trends across waves of infections.

3. Vaccination Impact:
Analyze the relationship between vaccination rates and case/death numbers.
Identify regions with high vaccination coverage and low case/death rates.
Evaluate the effectiveness of different vaccine types.

3. Demographic Analysis:
Investigate the impact of age, gender, and other demographics on susceptibility and outcomes.
Identify vulnerable populations for targeted interventions.
Analyze healthcare resource allocation based on affected demographics.
